Buildiso is mainly a web app to simplify creation of cobbler boot ISOs in an environment where PXE-boot not possible.
In recent cobbler-web (the upstream project) has this feature already, but for users of older cobbler versions 
this might be interesting, especially if you're using Spacewalk/RHN Satellite which comes with older release of cobbler.
